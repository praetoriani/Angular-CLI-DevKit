CURRENT TODO (08.01.2024)

-> WE NEED TO RE-DEVELOP THE MODAL WINDOW
   IT ACTUALLY WORKS, BUT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO SPLIT THIS UP IN
   1) A GLOBAL SERVICE THAT HANDLES ALL THE CONFIGURATION OF THE MODAL WINDOW
   2) THE COMPONENT ITSELF (CONTAINING A TS WITH INLINE SCSS AND A HTML FILE)
   SHOULDNT BE THAT ROUGH, CAUSE MOST OF THE COSE IS ALREADY THERE

[ ] IF THE MODAL WINDOW IS COMPLETED WE HAVE TO INJECT IT INTO THE create-new-project-app.ts

[X] THE ONLY OPTION WHICH IS MISSING ON THE create-new-project-app.html IS THE "CREATE SCRIPT" OPTION.
    SO WE NEED TO CREATE THE HTML-CODE AS WELL AS SOME CODE TO REALIZE THAT LAST FEATURE

[ ] ADD A 'WARNING' TO THE 'CREATE SCRIPT' PAGE. REASON:
    IF WE OUSH THE BUTTON, WE CANNOT EDIT THE PROJECT ANYMORE (GLOBAL ARRAY WILL BE DELETED)

[ ] THE 'SAVE CHANGES' OPTION ON THE 'EDIT PROJECT' PAGE IS STILL MISSING
    WE SIMPLY NEED A FUNCTION WHICH CAN UPDATE A SPECIFIC PART OF AN TWO-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY


-> THE INFO PAGE IS STILL MISSING

-> THE HELP PAGE IS STILL MISSING
